# berkley-database-6.2.23

This project started from the revival of the Berkeley DB version 1.85,
which was current in about 1995. Version 6.2.23 came into my hands,
and needed to be set free. The idea is to revive it as fully and
completely freeware, with no login or user credentials required. And
no passwords and no email opt-outs and no reminder adware. Just free,
like it was meant to be by the original authors.

To-do

Ideally, we would like your help to write a GNU-style or
configure-make-install wrapper around the guts, or better yet cmake if
possible. That way, the build_* directories will vanish, and the
build_* code snippets will need to move to an #ifdef compiler
directive style. Longer term, this will necessitate a few helpers with
access to other machines than my macosx. The guts and the
functionality must not change. Minor tweaks like command-line options
might be welcome but only if they are coded in the style of the
original, stripped-down no-nonsense old-school code. No flight sim
need apply.

Please feel free to contribute if you can stick to my vision.

Enjoy the code!
